testbookprod7,Runaway,books,10.99,Vintage,Runaway,352,Alice Munro,"The incomparable Alice Munro's bestselling and rapturously acclaimed Runaway is a book of extraordinary stories about love and its infinite betrayals and surprises, from the title story about a young woman who, though she thinks she wants to, is incapable of leaving her husband, to three stories about a woman named Juliet and the emotions that complicate the luster of her intimate relationships. In Munro's hands, the people she writes about-- women of all ages and circumstances, and their friends, lovers, parents, and children-- become as vivid as our own neighbors. It is her miraculous gift to make these stories as real and unforgettable as our own.",1400077915
